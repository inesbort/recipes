Ines Bort Altunaga, Viduna Athavan and Divya Soogrim SEPP prototype 
Information from the fridge is hardcoded on the SSHApp, the line   
      List<String> neededIngredients = List.of("Chicken"); 
 is meant to represent data from the fridge.

 In order to run the program, the database needs to be installed in the device running it.
 The username and password for the postgres database are also hardcoded, in the TheProtoype class.
 These would have to be chaned to be accurate if the program is run with another postgres user/database.
